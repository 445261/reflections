When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
you might want to create a remote repository when you have a feature done or just want to back up your code (if the feature is unfinished maybe on a different branch)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repositoy?
You might be working on something and changing a part of it or someone else might of made changes to the remote files, if updated it might clash cause bugs.  If you do it manually you will merge all at once and see any conflicts.
